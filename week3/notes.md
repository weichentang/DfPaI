# Week 3

## Terminal

### Basic Commands

* `cd` moves folders, e.g. `cd Documents`
* `ls` lists contents of folder 
* `pwd` prints working directory, i.e. the folder path that we're in

### Tips

* `Control + c` closes the current program
* `Control + e` moves the cursor to the end of the line
* `Control + a` moves the cursor to the beginning of the line
* `Control + d` tell the interpreter that we're done


## Python

* No types! `a = 2` is all you need (not `int a = 2;`)
* No semicolons
* No braces ({ or }), indentation is used instead


a bit of TEXT and 3!
