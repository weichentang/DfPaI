## Bouncing Balls

This sketch has lots of problems. Fix them!

What you should end up with is 100 balls moving around the window.

Then, do the following:

* Make each ball a different colour
* Make each ball bounce off each other (you might want to decrease the number of balls)
* Make the balls move towards the mouse when the mouse is pressed
